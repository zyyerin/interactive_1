    	<h1>Chuuni influenza</h1>
        <h2>By Erin Zhang, adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza" target="_blank">this article</a>, this is not that serious</h2>
    	
    	<p><strong>Chuuni Byou</strong>, also known as Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome, is an infection caused by any one of several types of Chuuni viruses. Chuuni virus (CNV) or Chuuni-origin influenza virus (CN-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in fourteen-year-old kids. The known CNV strains include influenza DQN, Subcultural, Evil Eye.
    	<br>Chuuni influenza virus is common throughout 14-year-old school kid populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from one teenager to another is not common and does not always lead to more Chuuni Byou, often resulting only in the production of confusion, anger or indifference. If transmission does cause new Chuuni Byou, it is called pathetic. People with regular exposure to Chuuni Byou are not at increased risk of Chuuni infection.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Signs and symptoms</h1>
        <p>Direct transmission of a Chuuni virus from a teenager to an adult is occasionally possible. In all, 77 cases are known to have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958, which have resulted in a total of 7 deaths. Despite these apparently low numbers of infections, the true rate of infection may be higher, since most cases only cause a very mild disease, and will probably never be reported or diagnosed.<br>
        Around the late-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission between humans. Since then, a few transmissions have been confirmed. Symptoms of Chuuni Byou vary significantly among individuals, including chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness, general discomfort and more.<br>
        The most common cause of death is unbearable embarrassment. Other causes of death are social isolation, superstition, etc. Fatalities are most likely in people cured.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Transmission</h1>
        <p>Influenza is quite common in school, with about half of middle school students having been exposed to the virus in the world. Antibodies to the virus are less common in teenagers than in adults.
        <br>The main route of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected teenagers. These close contacts are particularly common in clubs. Watching animation, reading light novels and playing video games may also increase the risk of transmission. The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by language exchange or imitation.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Classification</h1>
        <p><i>The three listed are classic Chuuni Byou types. Yet Chuuni Byou is not limited by these three categories.</i><br style="line-height:2.5em">

        <strong>DQN</strong> (DQN系, dokyun-kei) - Pretends to be anti-social or acts like a delinquent when in fact he or she is not or cannot become like either one. Tells made up stories about gang fights or crimes, or boasts and pretends to know about that subculture. "DQN" is slang for "antisocial person" or "annoying delinquent”.<br>

        <strong>Subcultural/Hipster</strong> (サブカル系, sabukaru-kei) - Often avoids everything mainstream and has a heavy preference to "things that few people like" and establishes themselves as being special. People of this type do not really love the subculture itself but rather strive to obtain the "cool" factor by not having the same interests as others.<br>

        <strong>Evil Eye</strong> (邪気眼系, jakigan-kei) - Admires mystical powers and thinks that he or she has a hidden power within them as well. It is this trait that they create an alias specifically for said power. This is also known as the delusional type.</p></div>
