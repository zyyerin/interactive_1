<p>Melos decides to assassinate the King, but is caught and arrested. He pleads with the King to give him three days so that he can attend his younger sister's wedding. The King agrees on one condition: that Melos' friend is left as a hostage, and if Melos does not return in three days, he will be executed instead of Melos.</p>

<p>After the wedding is over Melos hurries back to the city. Along the way he encounters many tribulations, such as a broken bridge due to the overflowing of the river. All of these things exhaust him, and he nearly gives up, but then continues to run for the sake of his friend's life.</p>
